<objective>
Document skill orchestration and workflow integration with frontend-design.

Purpose: Requirements INT-01, INT-07, and INT-08 specify GSD workflow integration and auto-enhancement. This plan documents how KUI Design integrates with the frontend-design skill and provides configuration examples for auto-invocation.

Output: Updated skill documentation with integration instructions and a hooks directory with workflow integration examples.

  <name>Task 1: Create hooks directory and integration guide</name>

Create a hooks directory and document how to integrate KUI Design with frontend workflows:

```markdown
# Frontend Enhancement Hook

Integration guide for auto-invoking KUI Design during frontend development.

## Overview

KUI Design can be automatically invoked when building frontend components to suggest relevant design patterns. This integration works with the frontend-design skill or any frontend development workflow.

## Setup: CLAUDE.md Configuration

Add the following to your project's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

### Basic Auto-Suggestion

```markdown
## Frontend Development

When building frontend components:
1. Before implementing forms, check for patterns: `/kui-design:suggest forms`
2. Before implementing navigation, check for patterns: `/kui-design:suggest navigation`
3. Before implementing layouts, check for patterns: `/kui-design:suggest layout`
```

### Full Integration

```markdown
## Frontend Workflow Integration

When I start building any frontend component or page:

1. **Analyze Context**: Identify what I'm building (form, navigation, layout, etc.)
2. **Check Patterns**: Run `/kui-design:suggest [component type]` for relevant patterns
3. **Review Suggestions**: Present pattern suggestions with relevance scores
4. **Apply Patterns**: If user selects a pattern, run `/kui-design:generate [pattern]`

### Pattern Trigger Keywords

Automatically suggest patterns when task mentions:
- **Forms**: form, input, validation, submit, field
- **Navigation**: nav, menu, sidebar, header, tabs
- **Layout**: grid, container, section, hero, responsive
- **Feedback**: loading, spinner, toast, alert, notification
- **Data**: table, card, list, chart, stats

### Integration with frontend-design

When frontend-design skill is building components:
1. After design direction is chosen
2. Before implementation begins
3. Suggest patterns that match the aesthetic direction
```

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Building a Login Page

```
User: Build a login page for my SaaS app

Claude (with integration):
1. Recognizes: login, form, authentication keywords
2. Auto-runs: /kui-design:suggest login form authentication
3. Presents: 3-5 relevant patterns (login forms, validation states)
4. User selects: "Floating Label Input" pattern
5. Generates: React code with pattern applied
6. Continues: Building the rest of the page
```

### Example 2: Dashboard Layout

```
User: Create a dashboard with stats and data tables

Claude (with integration):
1. Recognizes: dashboard, stats, table, layout keywords
2. Auto-runs: /kui-design:suggest layout data-display
3. Presents: Grid patterns, stat cards, table patterns
4. User reviews: Pattern suggestions
5. Applies: Selected patterns to implementation
```

## Context Isolation

KUI Design sub-commands operate in isolation:

- **:suggest** — Read-only, queries pattern index
- **:generate** — Read patterns, outputs code
- **:analyze** — Read URLs, writes new patterns

Each command can be invoked independently without affecting the main conversation context significantly.

## Performance Notes

- Pattern suggestions use in-memory index (sub-100ms)
- Framework detection is cached
- Pattern loading is lazy (only loads selected patterns)

## Disabling Auto-Enhancement

To disable auto-suggestions in a project:

```markdown
## Frontend Development

Do NOT auto-invoke KUI Design patterns. Only use when explicitly requested.
```
```
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# Directory and file exist
ls -la skills/kui-design/hooks/

# Contains expected sections
grep -E "^## (Setup|Workflow|Context)" skills/kui-design/hooks/frontend-enhance.md
```
  </verify>
  <done>hooks/frontend-enhance.md documents integration with frontend workflows</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update SKILL.md with integration documentation</name>
  <files>skills/kui-design/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Update SKILL.md to include integration and orchestration documentation. Add new sections:

1. After "Pattern Extraction" section, add:

```markdown
## Workflow Integration

KUI Design integrates with frontend development workflows:

### Auto-Enhancement Mode

When configured in CLAUDE.md, KUI Design automatically suggests patterns during frontend work:
- Detects component types from task description
- Suggests relevant patterns with relevance scores
- Provides code generation on pattern selection

See `skills/kui-design/hooks/frontend-enhance.md` for setup instructions.

### Sub-Command Orchestration

The main skill routes to sub-commands based on user intent:

| Intent | Command | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Get suggestions | :suggest | "What patterns for a form?" |
| Generate code | :generate | "Generate the login form" |
| Extract patterns | :analyze | "Analyze this website" |

### Integration with frontend-design Skill

When used alongside the frontend-design skill:
1. frontend-design establishes design direction
2. kui-design suggests patterns matching that aesthetic
3. Generated code follows both the pattern and design direction

Configure in CLAUDE.md to enable automatic pattern suggestions during frontend-design workflows.
```

2. Update the Available Sub-Commands section to ensure all three commands are listed:

```markdown
## Available Sub-Commands

- **:generate** — Search patterns and generate framework-specific code
- **:analyze** — Extract design patterns from a website URL
- **:suggest** — Get context-aware pattern suggestions based on task description
```
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# Check new sections exist
grep -E "Workflow Integration|Auto-Enhancement|Orchestration" skills/kui-design/SKILL.md

# Check all commands listed
grep -c ":suggest\|:generate\|:analyze" skills/kui-design/SKILL.md
```
  </verify>
  <done>SKILL.md documents workflow integration, orchestration, and frontend-design integration</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Hooks directory exists with integration guide:
   ```bash
   ls -la skills/kui-design/hooks/
   cat skills/kui-design/hooks/frontend-enhance.md | head -30
   ```

2. SKILL.md has integration documentation:
   ```bash
   grep -A10 "Workflow Integration" skills/kui-design/SKILL.md
   ```

3. All three sub-commands documented:
   ```bash
   grep ":suggest\|:generate\|:analyze" skills/kui-design/SKILL.md
   ```
